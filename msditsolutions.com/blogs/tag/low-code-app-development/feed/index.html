<p class="p1">This process allows businesses to easily build custom applications with innovative functionalities to meet their specific business needs. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Instead of having to use complex programming languages, the low-code platforms enable you to leverage visual interfaces for app development.</p>
<p class="p1">The platforms come with drag and drop capabilities, ready-to-use templates, code snippets, and more features to make development easy.</p>
