</ul>

<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><b>Planning with the team</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4">After understanding the objectives, the team plans the creation of the sitemap &amp; draw the wireframes. These are the visual representation of the site that gives an example of what the site looks like. It gives the idea to the designer what pages will be there and figure out the user journey!</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><b>Decide on your CMS</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4">Most of the time, the clients have already planned and shared which content management system they want to work on. But what if your client has no idea about this and leaves it to you? In this scenario, the development team will determine which system would suit the website and meet the requirements. For example, choosing any robust CMS will be worth it if the web project needs hundreds of pages.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><b>Creating visual elements</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4">After covering all the background research, it&#8217;s time to start creating the visual elements. In this process, the development team takes care of the web page designing, print assets, branding assets and other social media graphics.<b> </b>In this process, the whole web development team divides their task based on their strength.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><b>Creation of content</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4">In between the process of designing the logo &amp; web pages, the content team initiates their task. The content team researches the business and its competitors to create eye-grabbing content on the site. The customization in designing a web page will also be done if required during this process.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><b>Review of the site for approval</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4">The website is almost ready, and now it turns out to take a review to detect small mistakes. After that, the team reveals the site to their client and waits patiently for their approval. During this stage, the client can also ask you for the changes in design. So, the web development team tries to gather all the comments from the client and make changes.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><b>Testing site</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4">This is<b> </b>the most important process of the web development workflow. In this step, the testing expert will fix the bug and check if any broken link is available, including any errors. The proofreading SEO settings and other processes have been checked to determine whether it&#8217;s implemented right or not.

<h2 class="p3"><b>Best Practices To Follow For Developing An Efficient Website:</b></h2>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><b>Always start with the plan</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4">Developers can foster their efficiency when they have a detailed plan in their minds. Always start with the purpose and idea to make the process smoother. The first step to success in developing any project is identifying the end goal. The developer should have an idea about what they are working for and what the desired results would look like.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><b>Be mindful of the user experience</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4">Be mindful of the user experience. Think from the user&#8217;s point of view and then determine how they react to the web pages. A website building won&#8217;t be worth it if it&#8217;s not user-friendly. This is why building a responsive site is necessary.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><b>Accessibility of the site</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4">You can see billions of websites on the internet, but do you know only a few meet the accessibility standards? So, before making your site live, ensure it has zero disabilities. Make it accessible for every user group.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><b>Count every code</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4">This is the golden rule by the developers that a beginner should follow. Don&#8217;t over-code your site with unnecessary coding. Writing more and more code makes a site bulky and tough to access. Complex codes look impressive, but those are riskier. It can bring lots of bugs and issues to your site. So, make sure every line you are writing matters.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><b>Consider compatibility</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4">The number of devices is rising and is expected to grow in the upcoming days. Therefore, the biggest task in a web development project is building a site compatible with every device. The site should be appropriately displayed on every screen size. This is the key to increasing the vast range of visitors to your site.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><b>Don&#8217;t be too creative</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4">Adding creativity is important to make any project unique. But don&#8217;t deviate too much because it can make the site far from the standards. Don&#8217;t try to mix up JavaScript and CSS with HTML because it makes the site messy.</p>
<p class="p2">These are some basic <span class="s1"><b>Web Development Workflow Best Practices</b> </span>that experienced &amp; beginner developers should follow.</p>
<p class="p2">When it comes to website development &amp; planning, there are so many things to learn! To grab the best position in the web development world, the user must follow the best industry practices.</p>
