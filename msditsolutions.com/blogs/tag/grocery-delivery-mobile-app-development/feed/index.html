<h2 class="p1"><b>Some Important Market Stats and Growth Facts to Know:</b></h2>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">As per a report submitted by the IBIS, this industry crossed the USD757 billion mark in 2021 with a growth rate of 2.1 percent.</li>

</ul>
<h2 class="p1"><b>Monetization or business models for grocery apps:</b></h2>
<p class="p1">Before you can begin with <b>Grocery Delivery App Development, </b>you need to choose a perfect business model to earn revenue. It is important to have a great revenue value to sustain for years in this competitive market. Some of the options that you can choose are:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b>Aggregated</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">Well, this business model is very generic. Here, the vendors partner with local grocery stores. This model covers all the functionalities of a vendor to place in the platform and works perfectly as a chain model. Everything can be done within a single place. Under this model, you will function as a mediator between the owner and the shopper. The development of such apps will also cost less.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">By exploring the menu list, the users can add the required items to the cart. Once done, they can check out the products and complete the payment. Once the payment is made, the users will get a confirmation notification, and they can track the order in real-time. The delivery of the groceries will be managed by the grocery store owner.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b>Dedicated</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">You can also prefer to go for a dedicated business model. Here you will control your services. Under this model, the sellers and vendors register on the platform, and they utilize your services to supply groceries to the customers. But you need to provide them with delivery executives.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b>Single Store App</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">In this grocery app model, you will develop the app for your store, and you will be responsible for dealing with all the tasks, like maintaining the app, keeping the menu updated, collecting payments, delivering the items, and resolving customers&#8217; queries, and more.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b>Subscription</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">Here, the users will buy a membership to use the app for a fixed period to enjoy the benefits of some premium services, like faster and free delivery, extra discounts, and more.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b>Commission</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">Well, this may be an old business model, but it works. In general, for every sale through the app, the sellers will get commissions. At the same time, a small percentage of money is charged to the buyers for purchasing the groceries through the app and the sellers who register their portals on your platform.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">No matter what business or app model you choose, the primary purpose of developing a grocery delivery mobile app will be to make the process easier and more comfortable for your users while offering them an amazing user experience.</p>
<h2 class="p1"><b>Understanding the Cost of Grocery Delivery App Development:</b></h2>
<p class="p1">Well, there are different factors that can affect the<b> Grocery Delivery Mobile App Development Cost. </b>Some of the common factors to consider here are:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Then, you need to choose between the platforms, i.e., Android or iOS.
