										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With increasing digital advancements come major security threats by cybercriminal activities. So, the process should use proper security measures if you want to develop a custom web application. You can work with a </span><a href="https://wangoes.com/"><b>custom web application development company in USA</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to build your application and secure your customer data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can improve the customer experience through sales and data security on your online business. Attackers can find vulnerabilities that cause data to be breached without proper security measures in place. Therefore, your web developer should take the necessary steps to ensure protection against cybersecurity threats. Here&#8217;s how a web development company can help you improve your web security. </span></p>
<p><b>New-Gen Developers Use Automation to Operate Security Tools</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will provide you with a security team to conduct security testing when you work with a reliable </span><a href="https://wangoes.com/"><b>custom website development company in USA</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Since automation and integration improve the efficiency of cyber security processes, your developer will integrate such automated security tools to prevent security risks in the network. So you won&#8217;t depend on using open-source tools or manual operations. </span></p>
<p><b>Developers will Integrate a vulnerability scanner </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cross-site resources and SQL injections can make your web application vulnerable. They put your website more at risk than making the wrong configuration. So, your </span><a href="https://wangoes.com/"><b>custom web application development company in USA</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will ensure you know about such vulnerabilities. They will use secure coding and customized tools to develop a secure web application. Moreover, your developer will integrate vulnerability scanners into your network to detect them and control them without any manual work. </span></p>
<p><b>Developers will plan a strategic cybersecurity framework</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must learn about the web application vulnerabilities to feel responsible for the security. Hiring a </span><a href="https://wangoes.com/"><b>website design and development company in USA</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will help with implementing secure DevOps and educate your team. They would research the security risks on your network to make a cyber attack response plan. It helps them use the right cybersecurity framework for the web application. </span></p>
<p><b>Final Takeaways</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you work with a professional web development company, it can help you keep your sensitive information safe. Their developer will perform security exercises to find risks and provide security measures to eliminate them. However, you need to include your team to follow proper security practices to ensure the security measures protect you from cyber threats.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different people have different perspectives about what a perfect website looks like. For the success of any website, web designing plays a strong role. Designing a site is a major factor that shares the credibility of your business. It will influence the bounce rate &amp; conversion of the business. In this blog, we have mentioned a few tips for designing your business website from a </span><a href="https://wangoes.com/custom-web-design-development-company.html"><b>website design and development company in USA</b></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2023.</span></p>
<p><b>Important factors you must consider while designing a website</b></p>
<p><b>Consider the site speed </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The speed of your site influences the bounce rate and also improves the revenue and conversions. If the site is slow, the visitors will jump to the next website without sticking to your business. Users who search for your services consider different factors before purchasing a service, for example, the loading speed, ranking, etc. For these reasons, try to make your site fast and secure!</span></p>
<p><b>Leveraging the fold</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a heated debate on the internet. Some experts said due to the huge options of screen size, the fold doesn&#8217;t matter a lot. Well, others have different opinions. You must prioritize the content and use clear &amp; descriptive headlines. Include a call to action and media to make it look more impressive.</span></p>
<p><b>Keep the website simple</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&#8217;t exaggerate the website look; otherwise, it can make the look worse. Keep the website simple. Rethink the sidebar and stick to the standard layouts if you want to make it look impressive. It would be great if you stick with the familiar design layouts. Avoid using sliders, tabs, and carousels.</span></p>
<p><b>Give priorities to click</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give enough priorities to call to action buttons rather than prioritizing the scrolling. Users love to click the call to action buttons rather than scrolling and reading the contents. If you have many pages on the website where you have written lots of content to describe it, make a change!</span></p>
<p><b>Grab direct attention with visual cues</b></p>
<p><a href="https://wangoes.com/custom-web-design-development-company.html"><b>Custom web application development company in USA </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">also play an important role in guiding users. Try to give different weightage to different elements by directing the focus where you want to go! Well, you can use direct visual clues. You must use the right list of orders and leverage the site with social proof to gain trust.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you going to develop or re-design your business website soon? If yes, meet with the </span><a href="https://wangoes.com/custom-web-design-development-company.html"><b>custom website development company in USA</b></a><b>, <a href="https://wangoes.com/">MSD IT Solutions</a></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
