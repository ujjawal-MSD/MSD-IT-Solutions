The HTML document is the place where all components are rendered.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">AngularJS is defined as a fully-featured JavaScript framework that developers use to build dynamic web applications.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The framework was initially developed by Misko Hevery and Adam Abrons in 2009, but now it is maintained by Google.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The framework is based on JavaScript and HTML for building Single Page Applications.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">AngularJS is included in the HTML page with a tag &lt;script&gt;.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The framework can extend HTML with built-in attributes and binds data to HTML along with Expressions.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p4\"><b>ReactJS<\/b> <b>Vs<\/b> <b>AngularJS \u2013 Based On Key Characteristics:<\/b><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\">The below <b>difference between ReactJS and AngularJS<\/b> is based on key characteristics.<\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\"><b>Performance<\/b> <b>Analysis<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p5\"><b>AngularJS &#8211;<\/b> It uses real DOM and is preferred as the right choice for single-page applications. The framework uses a two-way data binding process for replicating the modifications. It is transformed into views efficiently with enhanced security.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><b>ReactJS &#8211;<\/b> React library uses virtual DOM. Due to this, it enhances the application&#8217;s performance despite the factors such as size and frequency of content. For example, Instagram. It can run precisely on a single-direction data flow. It is available in a package with zero additional cost. ReactJS reduces errors and problems because of the slow performance of DOM. It further offers the best control on development works.<\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\"><b>Popularity<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p5\"><b>AngularJS &#8211;<\/b> The framework ensures easy availability of ready-to-use solutions.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><b>ReactJS &#8211;<\/b> It is popular enough but the occurrence of potential issues because of less preference for collaborations and contributions.<\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\"><b>Community Support<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p5\"><b>AngularJS &#8211; <\/b>The Global community support is highly beneficial for Angular. It made it the go-to framework for enterprises.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><b>ReactJS &#8211;<\/b> It has great community support on GitLab and GitHub.<\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\"><b>Scalability<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p5\"><b>AngularJS &#8211;<\/b> It is easier to scale up on its own design. It has a very powerful Command Line Interface.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><b>ReactJS &#8211;<\/b> With the help of virtual DOM and library, it ensures scalable development. The framework is preferred to build scalable components.<\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\"><b>Testing<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p5\"><b>AngularJS &#8211;<\/b> It is faster and easy because of its built-in features and functionalities. It can integrate dependency injection and testing tools for hassle-free and smooth components testing.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><b>ReactJS &#8211;<\/b> The framework uses Redux for testing applications and logs data changes faster.<\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\"><b>Dependency Injection<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p5\"><b>AngularJS &#8211;<\/b> In this JavaScript framework, the Hierarchical Dependency Injection system is used.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><b>ReactJS &#8211;<\/b> This framework doesn&#8217;t use any Dependency Injection concept.<\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\"><b>Migration<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p5\"><b>AngularJS &#8211;<\/b> As earlier discussed, it features in-built commands (a command line interface). It makes it convenient for application upgradation to the latest Angular version. This automatic upgradation makes the developmental process less time-consuming and tedious.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><b>ReactJS &#8211;<\/b> The framework provides seamless transitions and depends on external libraries for the migration of third-party components. Here, the web developers need to pay attention and constantly focus on third-party libraries to make them compatible with the latest versions. Therefore, it is a bit of a complex and time-consuming task.<\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\"><b>Development Lifecycle<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p5\"><b>AngularJS &#8211; <\/b>The JavaScript framework extends the HTML application to the web development code. It further reduces the learning dependency time. It offers smooth development with less effort.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><b>ReactJS &#8211;<\/b> The framework combines the smaller components into bigger ones for a final and complete view. Every component acts as an independent unit with a unique logic. Therefore, the changes made don&#8217;t affect the other parts. The updates are easy for management and assist the web developers in re-using the elements. The development lifecycle is time-saving and utilizes less effort. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\"><b>Written Language<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p5\"><b>AngularJS &#8211; <\/b>It is written in the Typescript language of Microsoft; it is a superset of ES6 -ECMAScript 6.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><b>ReactJS &#8211;<\/b> It is written in JavaScript language.<\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\"><b>Learning Curve<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p5\"><b>AngularJS &#8211;<\/b> The learning curve of the framework is steep. The IO framework provides many efficient ways of solving problems. But it has a complex component management system. It demands good command of various languages.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><b>ReactJS &#8211;<\/b> Here, the learning curve is relatively easy. It facilitates quick app development.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p6\"><b>Best For Front End-Developers &#8211;<\/b> <b>AngularJS Vs ReactJS:<\/b><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p7\">The usage of web applications is highly fueling up in every industrial sector.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\">If you are wondering which best JavaScript framework is best for the frontend developer, here is the answer for the <b>difference between ReactJS and AngularJS<\/b>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\">Both the frameworks are immensely popular and adopted by web developers worldwide.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\">ReactJS&#8217;s smooth function has taken over the majority of popularity among the developers.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\">However, AngularJS is not lacking behind; it is considered and made its position among the top JavaScript Framework.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\">The ability of ReactJS is still tested for websites with higher complexity.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\">The presence of prompt rendering and JSX makes it a resultant workflow stack, a highly impactful JavaScript library.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\">The JavaScript framework which fits the frontend application development depends on the end-user&#8217;s requirements.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\">Based on the requirement factor, the web developer can make the right choice.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p6\"><b>AngularJS Vs ReactJS<\/b> <b>\u2013 Based On The Project Requirement:<\/b><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p7\">The JavaScript frameworks &#8211; AngularJS and ReactJS have great support from their respective community.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\">Both are suitable for web application projects as they have strong documentation but with different philosophies and features.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\">This completely relies on how the application is addressed for development.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\">Based on the above characteristics, here is the <b>difference between ReactJS and AngularJS<\/b> to decide which is best for different project types.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\">You can go for ReactJS when your project plan is to expand the application&#8217;s functionalities in the future.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\">If your application project has dynamic content and later there is a chance of requirement and view change, ReactJS will be the right choice.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\">Further, you can update the application based on your needs.
