When it comes to web designing, the experts may refer to light or heavy elements based on the design requirements. Utilizing a correct proportion of every element is crucial to attaining a well-balanced website design.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\"><b>A Perfect Contrast</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p4\">In color theory, contrasting colors are utilized opposite one another on the color wheel. Web design also covers other areas where contrast can be applied. Every professional designer looks at contrast textures sizes as well as shapes to define as well as to make certain sections attractive.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\"><b>Emphasis</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p4\">Speaking about emphasis, this is one type of design principle that can be found in the intentional \u201chighlighting\u201d of different elements of the layout of the website. Just think about a page where more than 70 percent of the content is highlighted in yellow. Does it make anything stand out? Well, with emphasis, you can make a certain part of the website look important and make sure that those parts have crucial information.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\"><b>Consistency</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p4\">This is also called rhythm, or you can say repetition.

Front-end developers work as a bridge between web designers and back-end developers.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">They generally work on three major development languages; CSS-Cascading Style Sheets, HTML- Hypertext Markup Language, and JS- JavaScript.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Such languages and frameworks help in creating a complete website, from designing the primary layout to adding videos and images, utilizing various types of fonts and typography, creating interfaces, and more.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Now coming to the back-end development process includes managing data as well as requests from various servers.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">If your website has dynamic data, then you will have to go for full-fledged back-end services offered by a professional web development company.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">For instance, some websites may ask visitors or users to input their personal data to start using the services.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">In this case, your website needs to save this data and make it easily accessible for a later stage. That means your website will need a working database connection, and the connections can be directly linked to the server.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">A back-end website development process includes utilizing server languages, such as ASP.NET, PHP, and more. Besides, the developers also use other languages such as MySQL or SQL based on your project requirements.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Some important skills, as well as tools that are important for successful website development, are:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\">Web template design</li>\n<li class=\"li2\">CSS, HTML and JavaScript</li>\n<li class=\"li2\">Frameworks- Ember, ReactJS or AngularJS</li>\n<li class=\"li2\">CSS processors such as Sass or LESS</li>\n<li class=\"li2\">GitHub</li>\n<li class=\"li2\">Different libraries, for example, jQuery</li>\n<li class=\"li2\">SEO and more</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><b>Web Development And Web Design- Similarities:</b></h2>\n<p class=\"p2\">Both web development and web design are important for an organization that wants to have a robust online presence.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">These two things function closely together and can be handled by an expert or a single person.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Both web developers and designers should have programming knowledge, even though at different levels.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">They should have robust problem-solving and analytical skills as they need to test the functionalities and design options to ascertain the best fit.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">On the other hand, they both need to stay updated about the latest trends, innovations, and programs in their respective fields.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">When well-carried out, development, and design create an effective tech-driven concept that meets the company\u2019s unique vision, enabling you to get connected with more customers easily.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p5\"><b>Final Words:</b></h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">Now that you understand the <b>Difference Between Website Design and Website Development,</b> you know both web development and design play a crucial role in website development, and both are interrelated.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">It can be said that a web designer should understand all the design principles and then come up with outstanding layouts creatively; on the other hand, a web developer needs to focus on the coding part and logic-based thinking.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">No matter whether you need help in web designing or development, you can always trust <strong>MSD IT Solutions Pvt Ltd. </strong></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The company is quite popular for its amazing and cost-effective web design and development solutions.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Get in touch with them now.</p>\n",
