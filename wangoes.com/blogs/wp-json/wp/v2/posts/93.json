class=\"p1\">While searching for cost-effective <b>react native outsourcing <\/b>solutions, you will find India is offering the most affordable and best services.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And you don\u2019t have to compromise with the app quality.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Now, let\u2019s talk about some major factors that affect the <b>React Native App Development Cost in India.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><b>Complexity Level of the App<\/b><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">A React Native app can either have high, medium, or low complexity.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Different aspects can affect the app\u2019s complexity.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you go for any API Integration, then per integration, you may need to pay around USD 2000 to USD 3000.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">On the other hand, for each IoT integration, you may need to pay USD 15,000 to USD 25,000.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Besides, there are some other things to consider here, such as app deployment architecture model, in-app purchase, integration with your legacy systems, and more.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><b>Design of the App<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Another thing that can influence the <b>react native developer hourly rate in India <\/b>is the app design.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Design and prototyping are two crucial stages that can increase costs and also give the developers a clear direction.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If the design is simple, the cost will be low.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><b>User Authorization<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you are developing a React Native app that requires the users to be able to sign up or sign in, then the cost will be a little more than for the apps that don\u2019t have such a feature.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The choice is yours.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><b>Add-ons<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you are planning to make custom-focused React Native apps, then you may want to connect your mobile app to social media and may want to add some other features to make it easier to use by people.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Well, such custom add-ons are a crucial part of the cost and price of the app development process.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So, if you are low on budget, then choose the add-ons wisely.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><b>The Category of Your App<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">The complexity of your app will depend on the type of app you want to develop.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For instance, a calculator or timer would have standalone features that are less complex than the features of an e-commerce app.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The more features your React Native app will have, the most money you will have to pay for the development.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><b>Experience Of the Developer<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">The hourly rate of a <b>freelance reacts native developer <\/b>will depend on the type of project you want to do.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But hiring a freelance developer will be a cost-effective option compared to working with a large company.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Some people think that hiring a freelance developer means they will have to compromise the quality.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">However, the fact is, when you are with an experienced <b>react native freelancer, <\/b>you will get the desired results.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If your app development project is complex, then you should be ready for high costs as you will have to hire an experienced developer.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><b>Focus On Hardware<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">The more hardware you will connect with your React Native application, the greater will be the cost of your React Native app development.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For instance, developing an IoT mobile app utilizing React Native platform will cost you more than developing a native app.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><b>Location of the Agency<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Location will be crucial when it comes to the cost of developing a React Native app.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And if you want to keep the cost low, then you can work with a <b>react native freelancer <\/b>or app development company based in India.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A freelance app developer may charge you around USD 15 to USD 60 or more based on your app development requirements.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><b>App Maintenance<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Don\u2019t think that your expense will end once the app is launched.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">You need to keep the app updated to meet the users\u2019 expectations.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When it comes to maintaining the app, you may need to consider three important processes: app bug fixes, app updates, and design changes.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As per some reports, the app maintenance cost for a year can be around 20 percent of the total development cost.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><b>Distribution of Your React Native App<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">When you plan about how to launch your app, each way will charge a different fee.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">App stores like Apple App Store and Google Play Store may charge around USD 100 for a license.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">However, you should keep in mind that your app will need permission from the host to meet the security rules and standards.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><b>Final Words<\/b><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you are a start-up and want to develop a quality mobile app but have
