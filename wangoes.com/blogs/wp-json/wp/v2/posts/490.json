Moreover, take server-side security measures and conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to prevent site vulnerabilities.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">App security might not be directly related to your benefits, but it&#8217;s a necessity as any security breach can cost too much and your consumer trust.
