										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It is no magic to prepare a live website. There is a wide range of skills and programs that go into the development process.</p>
<p class="p1">If you have finally decided to open the digitalization door to your business, then the process would start with having an official website of your company to stand out in the internet media.</p>
<p class="p1">Website development demands much-needed attention and investment, and all for good reasons.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">One major factor you need to consider is the web developer expense that determines how fast, responsive and scalable your website would be to appeal to your target customers and attract attention more frequently.</p>
<p class="p1">Hence, whether you are hiring a freelance developer to optimize your website or in the early stages of planning your website, you must consider some aspects to know the <b>freelance full stack developer charges</b> so you have full control over your budget and achieve the desired results.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">The full stack developers are capable of working across a range of technological products, fulfilling the back-end to front-end programming and more.</p>
<p class="p1">There is a rather high demand for full stack developers as more startup companies are growing up and growing demand for building proprietary tech tools and products.</p>
<p class="p1">Hence, working with full-stack developers is rather easy and straightforward than working with a web development company.</p>
<h2 class="p1"><b>What full stack developer works on?</b></h2>
<p class="p1">Most full-stack developers work as freelancers, so they are well-versed with both back-end and front-end web development as well as everything that comes in between.</p>
<p class="p1">Since they are creative and inventive in bridging all aspects of front-end and back-end developments, <b>freelance full-stack developer charges</b> can vary from a different perspective.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">They work on the full spectrum of the web development process starting from communicating with clients to understand their requirements and from developing their online business planning to deliver the final product.</p>
<p class="p1">Their work can include creating the database for the website, preparing a solid website infrastructure for website construction, setting up online hosting servers, testing and troubleshooting, designing the web page, optimizing the website to run across all smart devices, and more.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><b>What type of development do you require?</b></h3>
<p class="p1">It is wrongly assumed that all web development works are operated the same way. However, web development projects can vary according to the nature of the project’s objective.</p>
<p class="p1">You might be required to build a website from scratch or optimize an existing website, or you might want to have a developer on standby to handle the maintenance work of a launched website.</p>
<p class="p1">The <b>freelance full stack developer charges </b>can differ according to the complexity level of your project, for instance, whether you want to develop a simple website with a few web pages or a full-fledged e-commerce site with smart features and add-ins.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b>Website development from scratch</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">It is always the most expensive to build a website from scratch compared to other types of web development. The full stack developer would have to start with basic JavaScript Programming; they can use add-ons like HTML5, content management system, mobile responsiveness, etc., which might require you to pay extra expenses.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b>Ongoing maintenance of an up-and-running site</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">No matter the type of website you have, each one of them requires ongoing maintenance. You might choose to do it yourself or hire a developer to do it. The freelance developer can help with making required updates, solving hosting issues, making tool integration in your site seamlessly, URL changes, or creating and adding new web pages. For this kind of development, you must have a long relationship with the developer instead of hiring anyone, so their work would not create a hitch in the original programming designs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b>Website design services</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">You might need a designing service for your website pages, blog posts, or other content addition. For such types of developments, the <b>freelance full stack developer charges </b>might include a one-time fee instead of hourly rates.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><b>How much would the freelance full stack developer cost?</b></h3>
<p class="p1">From coding to developing servers, managing databases to building web infrastructure, making API integration to working with internal project teams, solving tech issues to strengthening web security, a full stack developer does a lot.</p>
<p class="p1">They are a more cost-effective and efficient option than having your project assigned and handled by multiple developers.</p>
<p class="p1">The average <b>freelance full stack developer&#8217;s charges </b>can fall between $20 to $60 an hour. However, this cost evaluation can vary according to the CSS techniques. If you hire a more experienced developer, the cost can increase up to $100.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">This hourly cost is determined through making various considerations with factors including education, experience, technical skills, framework knowledge, project length, project difficulties, page count, commitment level, and from where you have hired them, etc.</p>
<p class="p1">The cost of a full-stack developer from Canada with two years of experience and a developer from Turkey with ten years of experience can be the same. Hence, it’s essential to look for a full-stack developer in the international freelance market to set the best cost rates for your project.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Apart from that, the flat rate of a web developer also matters to check out as you know exactly how much you would be paying the developer upfront. The developer would question you extensively before offering you the flat rate after understanding your budget and other project requirements.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
