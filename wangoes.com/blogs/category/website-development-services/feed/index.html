										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different people have different perspectives about what a perfect website looks like. For the success of any website, web designing plays a strong role. Designing a site is a major factor that shares the credibility of your business. It will influence the bounce rate &amp; conversion of the business. In this blog, we have mentioned a few tips for designing your business website from a </span><a href="https://wangoes.com/custom-web-design-development-company.html"><b>website design and development company in USA</b></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2023.</span></p>
<p><b>Important factors you must consider while designing a website</b></p>
<p><b>Consider the site speed </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The speed of your site influences the bounce rate and also improves the revenue and conversions. If the site is slow, the visitors will jump to the next website without sticking to your business. Users who search for your services consider different factors before purchasing a service, for example, the loading speed, ranking, etc. For these reasons, try to make your site fast and secure!</span></p>
<p><b>Leveraging the fold</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a heated debate on the internet. Some experts said due to the huge options of screen size, the fold doesn&#8217;t matter a lot. Well, others have different opinions. You must prioritize the content and use clear &amp; descriptive headlines. Include a call to action and media to make it look more impressive.</span></p>
<p><b>Keep the website simple</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&#8217;t exaggerate the website look; otherwise, it can make the look worse. Keep the website simple. Rethink the sidebar and stick to the standard layouts if you want to make it look impressive. It would be great if you stick with the familiar design layouts. Avoid using sliders, tabs, and carousels.</span></p>
<p><b>Give priorities to click</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give enough priorities to call to action buttons rather than prioritizing the scrolling. Users love to click the call to action buttons rather than scrolling and reading the contents. If you have many pages on the website where you have written lots of content to describe it, make a change!</span></p>
<p><b>Grab direct attention with visual cues</b></p>
<p><a href="https://wangoes.com/custom-web-design-development-company.html"><b>Custom web application development company in USA </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">also play an important role in guiding users. Try to give different weightage to different elements by directing the focus where you want to go! Well, you can use direct visual clues. You must use the right list of orders and leverage the site with social proof to gain trust.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you going to develop or re-design your business website soon? If yes, meet with the </span><a href="https://wangoes.com/custom-web-design-development-company.html"><b>custom website development company in USA</b></a><b>, <a href="https://wangoes.com/">Wangoes Technologies</a></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
