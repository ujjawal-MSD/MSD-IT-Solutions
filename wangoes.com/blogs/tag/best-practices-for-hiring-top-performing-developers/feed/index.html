										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">There is no doubt that software developers can greatly impact today&#8217;s world, starting from small apps to some advanced innovations, such as cloud services, IoT, ML, AI, and more.</p>
<p class="p1">As developers are the primary force for progress, they are always in high demand.</p>
<p class="p1">But <b>How to Hire Top Performing Developers?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p1">Well, this can be a challenging task. Choosing a top software developer is multi-faceted expertise that includes technical knowledge, social media, instinct, and performance monitoring.</p>
<p class="p1">As per a study, more than 86 percent of IT executives have agreed that finding the right tech talent is difficult.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Choosing the best app or software developer can make a great impact on your company.</p>
<p class="p1">An experienced and skilled developer can be 400 percent more efficient than your team member.</p>
<p class="p1">That&#8217;s why companies like Twitter, Instagram, Google, and more always hire the top talents.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Well, these companies spend a lot of money and also have a lot of inbound developers. If you are a startup, then you may not follow the same recruitment techniques.</p>
<p class="p1">But that doesn&#8217;t mean that you can’t apply some of their recruitment practices in your own <b>How to Hire Top Performing Developers from India </b>strategy.</p>
<p class="p1">If you are feeling confused and want to get the best performing developers, then here are some tips that can help you in this. Let&#8217;s explore those tips.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><b>Where To Find Top Performing Developers?</b></h2>
<p class="p1">Before diving deep into <b>How to Hire Top Performing Developers, </b>let&#8217;s know where to hire the best and most skilled developers. Some of the best options to consider here is</p>
<p><b>1. Developer Communities and Blogs</b></p>
<p class="p2">Such resources will offer you an insight into the software developers&#8217; education, communication style, and technical skills. Developers&#8217; responses to different queries will allow you to understand how they solve a technical issue.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>2. Job Boards</b></p>
<p class="p2">One of the most popular ways to find good software or application developers is a job board. Here, companies post the jobs, and developers can directly apply for the jobs. All you need to do is come up with an attractive job advertisement for this.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>3. Recruiting Platforms</b></p>
<p class="p2">By working with the best recruiting platform, you can find top-performing developers faster. Such platforms will allow you to locate the right type of candidate utilizing the algorithms that search for the best match.</p>
<p><b>4. Tech Conferences and Events</b></p>
<p class="p2">Conferences gather many software developers, so it can be a perfect place to network as well as find talented developers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><b>Top Practices on How to Hire a Developer:</b></h2>
<p><b>1. Come Up with An Objective-Based Hiring Profile</b></p>
<p class="p2">As per the experts, screening out a developer who lacks experience or expertise with a specific programming language or framework is not an ideal way to find a good developer.</p>
<p class="p2">They say being familiar with a lot of programs, frameworks, or tools is not a factor that will determine the success of the developer.</p>
<p class="p2">A competent software developer can easily learn a new program faster.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">With new libraries and tools being released every day, you should focus on talent, not on skills.</p>
<p class="p2">Understand the kind of issue you want to solve, the outcomes you want to attain, and the challenges your developers may face.</p>
<p class="p2">Let the goals of the position and nature of the work decide the innate traits, strengths as well as the type of foundation knowledge that the candidates should possess.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>2. You Need to Structure Your Hiring Process Right</b></p>
<p class="p2">While understanding <b>How to Hire Top Performing Project Base Developers from India, </b>you need to structure your existing recruiting processes to attract the type of developers you want to hire.</p>
<p class="p2">Hiring the right developer will not only boost your company&#8217;s productivity but also increases employee satisfaction. Remember that enthusiasm and motivation go parallelly.</p>
<p class="p2">That means if you want to hire a motivated developer, then look for a candidate who is enthusiastic about the mission and vision of your startup.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>3. Attract the Right Talent with a Competitive Salary</b></p>
<p class="p2">One of the major factors to consider when exploring <b>How to Hire Top Performing Developers from India </b>is the salary.</p>
<p class="p2">As top-performing software developers are a crucial element of your company, you can&#8217;t take a risk by paying them a low salary.</p>
<p class="p2">Based on the location, the average salary will vary.</p>
<p class="p2">So, carefully check what the basic compensation for that location is.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">For example, the average salary of a software developer in India can range between Rs. 3 lakhs to Rs. 14 lakhs, based on their expertise and skill levels. On the other hand, in the USA, it can be up to USD 110,000 per year.</p>
<p class="p2">This is a major reason why companies hire remote developers from other countries.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">Countries like India offer plenty of skilled and talented app or software developers and compared to the developers from the USA; they don&#8217;t ask for much salary.</p>
<p class="p2">However, to attract and retain them, you need to offer them an attractive salary as the competition level is increasing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>4. Create Your Employer Brand</b></p>
<p class="p2">While talking about <b>How to Hire Top Performing Developers, </b>the<b> </b>employer&#8217;s band will play a great role.</p>
<p class="p2">If the employer brand doesn&#8217;t look very attractive, then it can make the hiring process a little difficult as the applicants know nothing about you, and they will not prefer to join your team.</p>
<p class="p2">As per some studies, developers usually prefer to work with companies that are well-known in the market.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">That&#8217;s why you need to remain on different platforms. Candidates consider you as an employer.</p>
<p class="p2">You need to keep interacting with them through job boards and social media sites to show more about you and tell them why they should choose you.</p>
<p class="p2">One of the effective ways to hire performing developers is to convert them into fans of your company.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>5. Properly Outline the Required Tech Stack</b></p>
<p class="p2">Every development task or technology requires a specialist who has experience and expertise in it.</p>
<p class="p2">When you decide to hire a developer for your company, you need to outline different technologies that the candidate will have to work with.</p>
<p class="p2">Understand what task a coder will solve?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">What programming languages or tools has the developer used? Not only just programming languages, but you also need to consider the front-end or back-end tool, framework, and databases.</p>
<p class="p2">Describing the tech stack properly will increase your chances of finding the best talent for the position. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>6. Focusing on The Professional Growth Opportunities</b></p>
<p class="p2">Another best practice to follow while thinking about <b>How to Hire Top Performing Developers from India </b>is sharing the career perspective with the applicants.</p>
<p class="p2">For most developers, the key motivational factor is professional advancement.</p>
<p class="p2">You need to get them involved in different challenging projects and offer chances to participate in training, conferences, webinars, and more.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">However, you need to ensure that the opportunities that are offered are the ones developers have been searching for. Coming up with an adjuvant ecosystem for employees&#8217; progress and self-development will help you to get a dedicated developer who will make more contributions to your organization.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>7. You Need to Value Hard and Soft Skills</b></p>
<p class="p2">Being a top-class specialist is as crucial as having a comprehensive set of soft skills.</p>
<p class="p2">As the development process is based on working in a team, time management, and problem-solving, you need to make sure that a candidate can obtain these skills as well.</p>
<p class="p2">If you are planning to hire a developer, you need to consider cultural peculiarities that can impact the candidate&#8217;s work ethic.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">For example, while hiring a developer from other countries, you can look for candidates with cultural similarities.</p>
<p class="p2">Developers from countries like India are well-known for their egalitarian working style, hard work, and high motivation. On the other hand, knowledge of the English language is also a crucial factor that makes Indian developers an ideal choice.</p>
<p class="p2">So, it can be said that hiring and managing an offshore team of developers is not that challenging.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>8. Look For Creativity</b></p>
<p class="p2">To create high-end apps or software, you will need a lot of conceptual as well as technical expertise.</p>
<p class="p2">However, if those were all that were required, then choosing a perfect developer for your company will be much easier for you.</p>
<p class="p2">You can find most of this information by using the Google search engine.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">The rapid advancement in software and app development is greatly driven by the ability to be very creative as well as imaginative.</p>
<p class="p2">You need to hire a candidate who is highly energetic and creative.</p>
<p class="p2">There is nothing wrong if the candidates are from a diverse background than your team. When it comes to developing software, creativity plays a major role.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>9. Keep Yourself Updated with Industry&#8217;s Trends</b></p>
<p class="p2">As per the experts, professional interest is another driving factor that can impact choosing an organization as a place to begin a career.</p>
<p class="p2">Tech companies who are enthusiastic about their constant development and growth can easily attract talented software engineers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">They know that there are multiple opportunities for mastering their skills, creativity, and career in that particular company.</p>
<p class="p2">Deploying new technologies and programming languages can create opportunities to grow as an expert and for your organization as a leading player in this industry.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Now that you understand <b>How to Hire Top Performing Project Base Developers from India, </b>it&#8217;s time to follow these tips and attract top-performing developers to your company.</p>
